## HtmlTextExtractor — documentation

This folder contains documentation for the small regex-only HTML-to-text extractor implemented in `extractor/__init__.py`.

Files

- `README.md` — high-level overview and quick usage notes.
- `internals.md` — extraction pipeline: the steps performed and the flow of data.
- `regexes.md` — detailed reference for every regular expression used in the extractor and what each one removes or transforms.
- `cli.md` — command-line interface options and their behavior.
- `faq.md` — limitations, known edge-cases and suggestions for improvements.

See the source implementation in `extractor/__init__.py` for the canonical behaviour. The docs below explain the logic in plain language and give examples and guidance on how to interpret the results.
